# Revolt Desktop (but better)

literally just adds a "url" option to the config.json for custom clients

exactly the same as the original, go read their readme

edit config.json found in AppData/Roaming/revolt-desktop or whatever OS you're using

add "url": "https://example.com" to the config file json
